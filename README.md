# Hi there 👋

I'm David, a Data Scientist in Melbourne, Australia. I use R and Python daily, and I also like to use a bit of Julia here and there. Talk to me about Data Science and R engineering.

In my spare time I explore machine learning practices and technology on my blog, [mdneuzerling.com](https://mdneuzerling.com/).

### R packages

I have a corgi named Parsnip, and he's the most perfect dog in the entire world:
